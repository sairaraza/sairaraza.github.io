### Machine learning tools for finding metamaterials

Below is a work in progress visualisation of machine learning tools used for material discovery that might be able to form a toolchain for the inverse design of metamaterials.

### Learning about Machine Learning

Outside of looking at existing research on the use of machine learning in material design I am continuing to read about machine learning to understand why certain tools are used in this field.
