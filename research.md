## From the Masters in Design for Emergent Futures course

The masters programme has given me the opportunity to research and collate information a number of short exercises leading up to a final year project. I have been using spreadsheets and the mapping tool [Kumu.io](https://kumu.io/) to store information but am always looking for new tools to make findings easier to navigate.

### The Lifecycle and applications of diatoms

For our module on material driven design I looked at a type of algae called diatoms that have extraordinary intricate glass shells with exceptional properties. As well as this when living, their class shells help them to photosynthesise carbon dioxide efficiently and they store energy mostly as oil. This map links these properties and processes throughout the diatom lifecycle to understand how these  might be used in technology or for inspiration.

### Mapping weak signals using scraped keywords from linked websites

In our module called The Atlas of Weak Signals each week we explored as teams design interventions responding to a different  “weak signals” that set trends and point to certain directions for futures. I used keywords scraped from websites by my classmates to create this visualisation of keywords that link weak signals of future changes. the results were not largely meaningful but taught us something about the data scraping process.

### Visualising the links between digital fabrication and computational material science

This was a visualisation of the links between tools of computational material science and digital fabrication that I had encountered from research papers for my project.

### A collection of details of experiments on metamaterial designs

I am in the process of completing data from research papers on experiments that test metamaterial designs to enable to show the metadevices that can be made and the tools to test them.

### A taxonomy of metamaterials (in progress)

This is also a work in progress looking to bring together taxonomies of metamaterials based on physical effects and geometries.

### A list of scientific research papers on inverse design of metamaterials using deep learning

I created this space with a view to document methods and tools of inverse designing metamaterials using machine learning with a view to find ways to test a method myself. These are taken from a wider review of inverse design in computational material science.

### Machine learning tools for finding metamaterials

Below is a work in progress visualisation of machine learning tools used for material discovery that might be able to form a toolchain for the inverse design of metamaterials.

### Building a training dataset

Below is a diagram showing the different ways of obtaining  datasets described in research papers on using deep learning to inverse design materials.

### Learning about Machine Learning

Outside of looking at existing research on the use of machine learning in material design I am continuing to read about machine learning to understand why certain tools are used in this field.

### Documenting projects


#### Mapping interesting geometries in scientific research

  Early on in the course I used this space to store interesting structures that I had found as inspiration for structures that I might be able to model, fabricate or research later in the course.

#### Finding project intervention paths

  This was a tool to collect and link themes of interest explored in the MDEF course with design approaches and narratives in order to form a preliminary proposal for my final project

#### Finding an intervention path as a group

  This exercise was a group exercise to propose interventions around the theme of materials and link them to themes explored in the masters course.

#### Mapping projects in the MDEF course

  This map was a start to map all projects in our class against the weak signals they respond to.

### Links between WASH infrastructure and completion of primary education

The following illustration was the result of keyword searching 160 field studies as part of a report commissioned by NRC. The report can be downloaded [here](https://gitlab.com/MDEF/2018/saira.raza/raw/master/docs/assets/SAIRA%20RAZA%20WASH%20and%20Schools%20Report%20211215.pdf?inline=false)

I was asked to write a short blog post on ways to address the digital gender divide based on recommendations from practitioners which can be read [here](https://www.rethinking-hygienepromotion.com/blog/2018/9/6/7-ways-to-address-the-digital-gender-gap)
